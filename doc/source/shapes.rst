Shapes
======

The **shapes** panel allows four different shapes to be drawn onto plots -
rectangles, lines, grids and circles. Additionally, a region of interest can be
set to the boundaries of any shape using the *set RoI* checkbox in its shape
dialog. This region of interested can be plotted in a separate MagicPlot window
using the *Plot RoI* button on the shapes panel. As well as by drawing, shapes
can be defined by typing in values to the shape dialog, or from the command line
by using the following MagicPlot functions:

.. automethod:: magicplot.magicplot.MagicPlot.addRect
    :noindex:
.. automethod:: magicplot.magicplot.MagicPlot.addLine
    :noindex:
.. automethod:: magicplot.magicplot.MagicPlot.addGrid
    :noindex:
.. automethod:: magicplot.magicplot.MagicPlot.addCircle
    :noindex:
